                <p>Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan exudes confidence that his government will be able to deal with a local-level anti-incumbency trend in the coming Assembly election by making changes to the candidate list and with a campaign focused on development and welfare programmes. Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Chouhan, who has served as Chief Minister for nearly 18 years, said the solution to the anti-incumbency trend was to remove candidates who faced it. “This is not an indiscriminate change in candidates, but one done after due assessment,” he said. Mr. Chouhan said he was “confident” that he would be able to overcome the challenge because of the work of his government.

In an order issued last Thursday, the Statistics Ministry said that the SCES, which was tasked with examining economic indicators only, will now be replaced by a Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS) which has a broader mandate to review the framework and results of all surveys conducted under the aegis of the National Statistical Office (NSO).</span>

He had mooted an overhaul of the system, and contended Indian Statistical Service has “little expertise in survey design”.</span>
